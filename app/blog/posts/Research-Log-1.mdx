## Podcasts & Talks

- [Christin Kim](https://x.com/christine_dkim) of [Galaxy Research](https://www.galaxy.com/authors/christine-kim/) hosts [Robert Miller](https://warpcast.com/bertcmiller) of [Flashbot](https://www.flashbots.net/)s on the specifics of MEV across rollups. Listen to the episode *Infinite Jungle* episode "Why MEV Looks Different on L2s" [here](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-mev-looks-different-on-l2s/id1728091874?i=1000657171406) or [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_H69slYWp8&list=PLz3vbkrzRoXR_XIWVqnZcX11REeC6acN2). As Miller states we "need to address MEV if we are [gonna] scale these rollups." Their conversation also touches on the searcher-originating spam problem on the networks.
- [Not An Essay: Jon Charbonneau on Composability, Stake Centralization and Bitcoin L2s](https://blockspace.media/podcast/not-an-essay-jon-charbonneau-on-composability-stake-centralization-and-bitcoin-l2s/) where [Gwart](https://x.com/GwartyGwart) hosts [Jon](https://x.com/jon_charb) and they talk about staking, re-staking and venture capital along the way. It is one of the most insightful conversations that I listened to lately.
- Not necessarily a podcast gathering by the usual framework when it comes to the *[The Chopping Block](https://unchainedcrypto.com/the-chopping-block/)* camaraderie but I really enjoyed this [Consensus](https://consensus2024.coindesk.com/) chit-chat by the gentlemen on the Coindesk TV where they discussed the celebrity merde-coins alongside the Trump verdict in a rather uplifting vibe. Starts at [07:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/live/ew01DzQ1ETw?si=YmzYH07e-DWBWO-m&t=26407).
- Nicholas [hosts](https://web3galaxybrain.com/episode/Jong-Kai-Yang-Co-Founder-of-HackMD) Jong-Kai Yang, the founder of HackMD, for the former'S *Web3 Galaxy Brain* podcast.
- [Andrew Miller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUyFUVRessg) on e2e apps in Gramine where controlled channel attacks are introduced.

## Articles & Essays

I am impressed at myself that I have postponed reading this post almost for about a year, having bookmarked it. No, it's not because of the recent ZK drama. I was just making an Airtable for verifiable computing projects on the cryptoeconomics vistæ.
- [Building Blocks—Closed Software, Competitions](https://hackmd.io/@ttsao/building-blks-competitions) by [Terence Tsao](https://warpcast.com/terence.eth).

## Posts, Threads

- Riley on crypto [usecases](https://x.com/jtriley_eth/status/1796628938581807268).
- Re: ZK trademark registry attempt drama across the cryptographically secured societies. Please make sure you read Thaler's above-linked post first before diving in. My resolution on the issue is that we do not need a defensive trademark thereof. If we were to talk about hijacking attemps, we first need to reflect on other cultural and PGF related ones that directly affects how resources come to be ratioed across our industry.

## The Art Market

- [Gallery](https://gallery.so/gokhan) spotlights [Maya Man](https://gallery.mirror.xyz/qr8Zs40PDa59XN1-lmVDOxEclEgThb8Nb3xg37t9c2Y) whose art I find valuable for the ecosystem. Man has a meta-approach with which she blends the infrastructure-inspired aesthetics with the quotidian nichés of the personal.
- Many have missed it but [Joan Heemskerk](https://x.com/JoanHeemskerk) from the legendary net dot art duo [JODI](https://net-art.org/jodi) issued a [self-reflective wallet-based art](https://doaw.folia.app/) project through Folia Berlin, a house of experimental inter-disciplinary art, the last year. Yes, it is on the mainnet. It's a self-reflective piece by the pioneer of internet-based infrastructure art wherein "the user generates endless wallets, interpreted across the screen in sound, color and words. Upon minting, they capture a point of randomness, storing it as the on-chain ID of the minted NFT. While the NFT is tethered to a single seed, the sub-infinite number of derived private keys score the endless animation."
